LDR - An LDR is a component that has a (variable) 
resistance that changes with the light intensity that 
falls upon it. This allows them to be used in light 
sensing circuits.
A Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) or a photo resistor 
is a device whose resistivity is a function of the 
incident electromagnetic radiation. Hence, they are 
light sensitive devices. They are also called as photo 
conductors, photo conductive cells or simply 
photocells.
The photons in the incident light must have energy superior 
than the bandgap of the material to make the electrons jump 
from one band to another band (valance to conduction). 
Hence, when light having ample energy, more electrons are 
excited to the conduction band which grades in a large 
number of charge carriers. When the effect of this process 
and the flow of the current starts flowing more, the 
resistance of the device decreases.
2- Basic functioning of LDR & its circuit designing.

Basic functioning of LDR -LDR is a component that has a 
(variable) resistance that changes with the light intensity 
that falls upon it. This allows them to be used in light sensing 
circuits.

How an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) Works
What is an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)?
An LDR is a component that has a (variable) resistance that 
changes with the light intensity that falls upon it. This allows 
them to be used in light sensing circuit. 

The working principle of an LDR is photoconductivity, that is 
nothing but an optical phenomenon. When the light is 
absorbed by the material then the conductivity of the 
material reduces. When the light falls on the LDR, then the 
electrons in the valence band of the material are eager to 
the conduction band.
